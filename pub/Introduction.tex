\section{Introduction}
There are two types of the dead time: paralyzable and nonparalyzable response. For the input homogeneous Poisson process with rate $R$, the observed rate $R^m$ are~\cite{muller19942} 
	The dead time extend by the lost PE in the dead time window.
	The dead time does not extend by other lost PE.

For the paralyzable response
\begin{equation}
	R^m=Re^{-RT_\mathrm{dead}}
\end{equation}
However, to inference the $R$ from $R_m$ need to solve the equation, which could be approximated with series~\cite{muller19942}. Besides, there exist two possible solution for the $R$

For the nonparalyzable response
\begin{equation}
	R^m=R(1-R^mT_\mathrm{dead})
\end{equation}
It is easy to inference $R$ from $R_m$ use above equation.
For the nonparalyzable response to calculate the correction $R_m$ from $R$
\begin{equation}
	R^m=R(1+RT_\mathrm{dead})
\end{equation}

The interval densities and the statistics of the homogeneous Poisson process also be investigated enough.
